# E-commerce Data Analysis with Python

This project demonstrates data extraction, cleaning, processing, and visualization techniques using Python and an international e-commerce dataset. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** Downloading the e-commerce dataset from a public source.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.
3. **Data Transformation:** Creating new features, aggregating data, and preparing for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data patterns.
5. **Data Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to communicate insights effectively.
6. **RFM Analysis:** (If included) Calculating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for customer segmentation.


## Tools and Technologies

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for data processing.
* **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Used for numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visualizations.
* **Ydata-Profiling:** For automated data profiling and reporting.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment for code development and documentation.
